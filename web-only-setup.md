# Getting Started with This Repository (Web Browser Only)

This guide explains how to use this repository **using only the GitHub web interface**. We recommend familiarising yourself with the web interface to GitHub. It is also useful if GitHub Desktop is unavailable.

👉 You do **not** need:
- Git
- GitHub Desktop
- The command line
- Any software installed locally

This approach is used for **Lab 1 only**, so that we can focus on *software engineering concepts*, not tools.

## What This Repository Is

This repository is a **template** provided for CMP-5012B.

You must:
- Create **your own copy** of this repository
- Work **only in your own copy**
- Edit files directly in your web browser

🚫 **Do not edit the original template repository**

---

## Step 1: Log in to GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Log in to your GitHub account  
   - If you don’t have one yet, create a free account first

---

## Step 2: Create Your Own Copy of the Template

1. Open the template repository:  
   https://github.com/alexatuea/cmp-5012b-template

2. Click **`Use this template`** (top right)

3. Select **`Create a new repository`**

4. Fill in:
   - **Owner**: your GitHub account
   - **Repository name**: e.g.
     ```
     cmp-5012b-lab1
     ```
   - **Visibility**: Public (unless told otherwise)

5. Click **`Create repository`**

✅ You now have your own independent copy of the template.

---

## Step 3: Explore the Files

In your repository, you should see files such as:

- `README.md`
- `project-vision.md`
- `user-stories.md`
- `acceptance-criteria.md`
- `student-guide.md`

Click on any file to view its contents.

---

## Step 4: Edit Files in the Browser

To edit a file:

1. Click the file name (e.g. `project-vision.md`)
2. Click the ✏️ **Edit** (pencil icon)
3. Make your changes
4. Scroll down to **Commit changes**
5. Enter a short commit message (e.g. *“Draft project vision”*)
6. Click **Commit changes**

Your changes are now saved.

---

## Step 5: Create New Files (If Needed)

If your lab requires additional documents:

1. Go to the repository home page
2. Click **Add file → Create new file**
3. Name the file (e.g. `stakeholders.md`)
4. Add content
5. Commit the file

---

## Step 6: Viewing Previous Changes

GitHub automatically tracks changes.

- Click **Commits** to see:
  - What changed
  - When it changed
  - Who made the change

This becomes important later when working in teams.

---

## Working in Teams (If Applicable)

If you are asked to collaborate:

1. Go to **Settings → Collaborators**
2. Add teammates by GitHub username
3. All team members can edit files via the browser

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Editing the original template repository
- ❌ Using **Fork** instead of **Use this template**
- ❌ Worrying about Git commands — not needed for this lab
- ❌ Treating this as a programming task

---

## Why We Are Doing This

This lab focuses on:
- Project vision
- User stories
- Acceptance criteria
- Shared understanding

We will introduce:
- Git
- Branches
- Local development
- Tooling workflows  

**later in the module**.

For now, the browser is enough.
