# CMP-5012B – Software Engineering Project Starter

This repository is a starter template for team projects in **CMP-5012B – Software Engineering**.

It provides a consistent structure for all the documentation and design artefacts required for
Coursework Part 1, and a place to put your implementation for Part 2.

### New to GitHub?  
Read [Getting Started (Web Browser Only)](web-only-setup.md) for information on working directly with the web interface.

For local workflow, we recommend using GitHub desktop. See the [GitHub Desktop Quick Start](github-desktop-quick-start.md) guide.

## Structure

- `/docs` – Text-based documentation (vision, user stories, acceptance criteria, etc.)
- `/design` – Diagrams and design artefacts (C4, wireframes, sequence diagrams, data model)
- `/planning` – Sprints, tasks, roadmap, risk register
- `/src` (you can create later) – Source code for implementation
- `/tests` (optional) – Tests for your system
