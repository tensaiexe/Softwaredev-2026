# GitHub Desktop Quick Start Guide

This guide explains how to use this repository with **GitHub Desktop**.

👉 You will need:
- A GitHub account
- GitHub Desktop installed
- Basic file editing tools (e.g. a text editor)

This guide is **optional**.  
If you prefer, you can complete Lab 1 using the **web browser only**.

---

## What This Repository Is

This repository is a **template** provided for CMP-5012B.

You must:
- Create **your own copy** of the template
- Clone **your copy**, not the original template
- Make changes locally and push them to GitHub

🚫 **Do not clone or edit the original template repository**

---

## Step 1: Install and Sign In to GitHub Desktop

1. Download GitHub Desktop from:  
   https://desktop.github.com

2. Install and open the application

3. Sign in using your GitHub account

---

## Step 2: Create Your Own Copy of the Template (On GitHub)

Before using GitHub Desktop, you must create your own repository on GitHub.

1. Open the template repository:  
   https://github.com/alexatuea/cmp-5012b-template

2. Click **`Use this template`**

3. Select **`Create a new repository`**

4. Fill in:
   - **Owner**: your GitHub account
   - **Repository name**: e.g.
     ```
     cmp-5012b-lab1
     ```
   - **Visibility**: Public (unless told otherwise)

5. Click **`Create repository`**

✅ You now have your own repository on GitHub.

---

## Step 3: Clone Your Repository Using GitHub Desktop

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**
2. Click **File → Clone repository**
3. Select the **GitHub.com** tab
4. Choose your newly created repository
5. Choose a local folder
6. Click **Clone**

Your repository is now copied to your computer.

---

## Step 4: Explore the Repository Locally

In your local folder, you should see files such as:

- `README.md`
- `project-vision.md`
- `user-stories.md`
- `acceptance-criteria.md`
- `student-guide.md`

Open these files in a text editor to read or edit them.

---

## Step 5: Make Changes Locally

1. Edit a file (e.g. `project-vision.md`)
2. Save the file

GitHub Desktop will automatically detect changes.

---

## Step 6: Commit Your Changes

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**
2. Review the list of changed files
3. Enter:
   - **Summary**: e.g. *Draft project vision*
   - **Description** (optional)
4. Click **Commit to main**

A commit is a saved checkpoint of your work.

---

## Step 7: Push Changes to GitHub

After committing:

1. Click **Push origin**
2. Your changes are uploaded to GitHub
3. Refresh your repository page in the browser to confirm

---

## Creating New Files

To add a new file:

1. Create the file locally (e.g. `stakeholders.md`)
2. Save it in the repository folder
3. Commit the new file in GitHub Desktop
4. Push your changes

---

## Working in Teams (If Applicable)

If working as a team:

- All team members must be added as **Collaborators** on GitHub
- Each member:
  - Pulls changes before starting work
  - Commits small, clear changes
  - Pushes regularly

⚠️ Avoid editing the same file at the same time early on.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Cloning the original template repository
- ❌ Forgetting to commit before pushing
- ❌ Editing files without pulling recent changes
- ❌ Treating GitHub Desktop as a backup tool only

---

## Why This Matters

Later in the module, you will:
- Use Git more actively
- Work with branches
- Resolve conflicts
- Collaborate on code

This guide gives you just enough Git workflow to get started safely.

---

## Alternative Option

If GitHub Desktop feels confusing right now, you can complete Lab 1 using:

👉 **Web Browser Only Setup**  
(see `web-only-setup.md`)

Both approaches are valid for this lab.

---

## Next Step

Once your repository is set up, return to the [Student Guide](student-guide.md) and follow the lab instructions.
Or, return to the [README](README.md) guide.
